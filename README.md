This is my Arduino sketchbook.

It really is just a sketchbook.  There may be end product things in here as I worked on them here but they will be moved out to another repo as they mature.

My toy Arduino that is just always attached to my machine is an Arduino with the AdaFruit pixel shield and the SparkFun wifi shield.

Don't always use everything, but sometime I do.
